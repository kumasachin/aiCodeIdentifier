# Railway Deployment Guide for AI Code Identifier

## Quick Deploy to Railway (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
Your repository is already set up perfectly! You have:
- ✅ requirements.txt
- ✅ app.py as main application
- ✅ Clean project structure

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `aiCodeIdentifier` repository
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Python app
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Start the app using app.py

### Step 3: Configure Environment (if needed)
Railway should auto-detect everything, but you can verify:
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python app.py`
- **Port**: Railway will auto-assign (Flask will bind to Railway's port)

### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
- Railway provides a free subdomain like: `your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- You can add a custom domain in the settings

### Step 5: Environment Variables (if needed)
Currently your app doesn't need any env vars, but if you add them later:
- Go to your Railway project settings
- Add variables in the Variables tab

### Expected Result
Your app will be live at: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`

### Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
3. Make sure app.py runs locally first

## Alternative: Heroku Deployment

### Step 1: Create Procfile
Create a file named `Procfile` (no extension) with:
```
web: gunicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### Step 2: Update requirements.txt
Add gunicorn to your requirements.txt:
```
gunicorn
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Heroku
1. Install Heroku CLI
2. Login: `heroku login`
3. Create app: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

## Performance Optimization for Production

### 1. Update app.py for production
Change the last lines in app.py from:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

To:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)
```

### 2. Add production WSGI server
Add to requirements.txt:
```
gunicorn>=20.1.0
```

### 3. Create production config
Create `wsgi.py`:
```python
from app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Security Considerations for Production

1. **Remove Debug Mode**: Set debug=False
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Consider flask-limiter
3. **File Upload Limits**: Add max file size limits
4. **HTTPS**: Use platform SSL (most platforms provide free SSL)
5. **Environment Variables**: For any sensitive config

## Cost Estimates

### Free Tiers:
- **Railway**: 500 hours/month, $5 after
- **Heroku**: 550 hours/month (sleeps after 30min)
- **Render**: Unlimited (but slower)

### Paid Options (if you outgrow free):
- **Railway**: $5/month for always-on
- **Heroku**: $7/month for hobby dyno
- **DigitalOcean**: $5/month droplet

## Monitoring & Analytics

Once deployed, consider adding:
- **Error tracking**: Sentry
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics
- **Uptime monitoring**: UptimeRobot
- **Performance**: New Relic (if needed)

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test the live application thoroughly
2. Share the URL in your README
3. Monitor performance and errors
4. Consider adding more features based on user feedback
5. Set up CI/CD for automatic deployments
